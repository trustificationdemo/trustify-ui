Feature: Scan SBOM - To Generate Vulnerability Report for SBOM
    As an RHTPA user
    I want to be able to scan an SBOM so that I can review the vulnerabilities within the SBOM without having to ingest

    Background: Authentication
        Given User is authenticated

    Scenario: Verify Generate Vulnerability Report option
        When User Navigates to SBOMs List page
        When User Clicks Generate Vulnerability Button
        Then The Application should navigate to Generate Vulnerability Report screen
        Then The Page should contain Browse files option and instruction to Drag and drop files

    Scenario: Generate Vulnerability Report For SBOM without any vulnerabilities
        Given User Navigated to Generate Vulnerability Report screen
        When User Selects SBOM "<fileName>" from "<filePath>" on the file explorer dialog window
        Then "No Vulnerabilities found" header should be displayed
        #Bug: TC-2985
        #Then "The "<fileName>" was analyzed and found no vulnerabilities report" message should be displayed
        Then "Try another file" button should be displayed
        When User Clicks on "Try another file" button
        Then Application navigates to Generate Vulnerability Report screen

        Examples:
            | fileName                          | filePath                     |
